THE FOLDER CONTAINS THREE PYTHON CODES NUMBERED ACCORDING TO THE ORDER OF EXECUTION. THE FIRST CODE ALLOWS YOU TO TRAIN THE MODEL AND PERFORM THE TRAINING AND VALIDATION STEPS. 
THE CODE ALSO SAVES THE TRAINED AND VALIDATED MODEL ALONG WITH THE METRICS STATISTICS (HYSTORY). 
THE SECOND CODE USES THE BUILT AND SAVED MODEL TO PRODUCE THE SEGEMENTATION OF ANY COASTAL IMAGE OTHER THAN THE TRAINING AND VALIDATION DATASET. 
MOREOVER THE SECOND CODE PERFORMS THE PROST PROCESSING OPERATIONS. THE LAST CODE (TO BE RUN ON QGIS) ALLOWS TO OBTAIN THE SHORELINE SHAPEFILE AFTER BUFFERING AND ISOLINE OPERATIONS.
